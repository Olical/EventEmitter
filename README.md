Listen adds the event functionality that NodeJS has to your browser.

So you can register and emit events from what ever objects you choose.

It works exactly the same as the NodeJS version so head over to the [NodeJS docs](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.5/api/events.html#events.EventEmitter) for the details.
